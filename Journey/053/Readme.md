## Cloud Research

### Why make a global application?
- A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
- On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations
- Decreased Latency
>• Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
<br>• It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US
<br>• Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience

- Disaster Recovery (DR)
>• If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)…
<br>• You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
<br>• A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application 
- Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack 


### Global AWS Infrastructure 
- Regions: For deploying 
applications and 
infrastructure
- Availability Zones: Made 
of multiple data centers
- Edge Locations (Points 
of Presence): for 
content delivery as 
close as possible to 
users
- More at: https://infrastructure.aws

### Global Applications in AWS
- Global DNS: Route 53
>• Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
<br>• Great for disaster recovery strategies

- Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
>• Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations – decrease latency
<br>• Cache common requests – improved user experience and decreased latency

- S3 Transfer Acceleration
>• Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3

- AWS Global Accelerator:
>• Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global 
network

### Amazon Route 53
- Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand 
how to reach a server through URLs. 
- In AWS, the most common records are:
>• www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
<br>• www.google.com => 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 == AAAA IPv6
<br>• search.google.com => www.google.com == CNAME: hostname to hostname
<br>• example.com => AWS resource == Alias (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc…)


### Amazon CloudFront
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Improves read performance, content 
is cached at the edge
- Improves users experience
- 216 Point of Presence globally (edge 
locations)
- DDoS protection (because 
worldwide), integration with Shield, 
AWS Web Application Firewall

### CloudFront – Origins 
- S3 bucket 
>• For distributing files and caching them at the edge 
<br>• Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) 
<br>• OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI) 
<br>• CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3) 

- Custom Origin (HTTP) 
>• Application Load Balancer 
<br>• EC2 instance 
<br>• S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website) 
<br>• Any HTTP backend you want


### CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
- CloudFront:
>• Global Edge network
<br>• Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
<br>• Great for static content that must be available everywhere

- S3 Cross Region Replication:
>• Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
<br>• Files are updated in near real-time
<br>• Read only
<br>• Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

### S3 Transfer Acceleration
• Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location 
which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region

### AWS Global Accelerator
- Improve global application availability
and performance using the AWS 
global network
- Leverage the AWS internal network 
to optimize the route to your 
application (60% improvement)
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your 
application and traffic is sent through 
Edge Locations
- The Edge locations send the traffic to 
your application

### AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
- CloudFront – Content Delivery Network
>• Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos) 
<br>• Content is served at the edge

- Global Accelerator 
>• No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
<br>• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP 
<br>• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses 
<br>• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

### AWS Outposts 
- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on- premises infrastructure alongside a cloud 
infrastructure
- Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems: 
>• One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, 
CLI, and AWS APIs)
<br>• One for their on-premises infrastructure 

- AWS Outposts are “server racks” that offers the 
same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools 
to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
- AWS will setup and manage “Outposts Racks” 
within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
- You are responsible for the Outposts Rack 
physical security

### AWS WaveLength
- WaveLength Zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications providers’ 
datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
- Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks
- Example: EC2, EBS, VPC…
- Ultra-low latency applications through 5G networks
- Traffic doesn’t leave the Communication Service 
Provider’s (CSP) network
- High-bandwidth and secure connection to the parent AWS Region
- No additional charges or service agreements
- Use cases: Smart Cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, Connected Vehicles, Interactive Live Video Streams, AR/VR, 
Real-time Gaming, …

### AWS Local Zones
- Places AWS compute, storage, database, 
and other selected AWS services closer 
to end users to run latency-sensitive 
applications
- Extend your VPC to more locations – “Extension of an AWS Region”
- Compatible with EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS, 
ElastiCache, Direct Connect … 
- Example:
>• AWS Region: N. Virginia (us-east-1)
<br>• AWS Local Zones: Boston, Chicago, Dallas, 
Houston, Miami, …
