### What is Cloud Computing? 
- Cloud Computing  is the on-demand-delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services


### The Deployment Models of the Cloud
- Private Cloud:
• Cloud services used by a
single organization, not
exposed to the public.
• Complete control
• Security for sensitive
applications
• Meet specific business
needs

- Public Cloud:
• Cloud resources owned
and operated by a thirdparty cloud service
provider delivered over
the Internet.
• Six Advantages of Cloud
Computing

- Hybrid Cloud:
• Keep some servers on
premises and extend
some capabilities to the
Cloud
• Control over sensitive
assets in your private
infrastructure
• Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the
public cloud

### The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self service:
• Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service
provider

- Broad network access:
• Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
• Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
• Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
• Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
• Quickly and easily scale based on demand

- Measured service:
• Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used


### Type of Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
• Provide building blocks for cloud IT
• Provides networking, computers, data storage space
• Highest level of flexibility
• Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT

- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
• Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
• Focus on the deployment and management of your applications

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
• Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider



## Next Steps

- AWS Global Infrastructure

## Social Proof
