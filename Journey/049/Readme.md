# AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeArtifact, AWS CodeStar, AWS Cloud9 (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Cloud Research

### AWS CodeDeploy
- We want to deploy our application 
automatically
- Works with EC2 Instances
- Works with On-Premises Servers
- Hybrid service 
- Servers / Instances must be provisioned 
and configured ahead of time with the 
CodeDeploy Agent

### AWS CodeCommit
- Before pushing the application code to servers, it needs to be stored 
somewhere
- Developers usually store code in a repository, using the Git technology
- A famous public offering is GitHub, AWS’ competing product is CodeCommit
- CodeCommit:
>• Source-control service that hosts Git-based repositories
<br>• Makes it easy to collaborate with others on code
<br>• The code changes are automatically versioned 

- Benefits: 
>• Fully managed
<br>• Scalable & highly available
<br>• Private, Secured, Integrated with AWS

### AWS CodeBuild
- Code building service in the cloud (name is obvious)
- Compiles source code, run tests, and produces packages that are ready to be 
deployed (by CodeDeploy for example)
- Benefits: 
>• Fully managed, serverless
<br>• Continuously scalable & highly available
<br>• Secure
<br>• Pay-as-you-go pricing – only pay for the build time

### AWS CodePipeline
- Orchestrate the different steps to have the code automatically pushed to production
>• Code => Build => Test => Provision => Deploy
<br>• Basis for CICD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery)

- Benefits:
>• Fully managed, compatible with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, 
CloudFormation, GitHub, 3rd-party services (GitHub…) & custom plugins…
<br>• Fast delivery & rapid updates

### AWS CodeArtifact
- Software packages depend on each other to be built (also called code 
dependencies), and new ones are created
- Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called artifact management
- Traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system
- CodeArtifact is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective artifact 
management for software development
- Works with common dependency management tools such as Maven, 
Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and NuGet
- Developers and CodeBuild can then retrieve dependencies straight from CodeArtifact

### AWS CodeStar
- Unified UI to easily manage software development activities in one place
- “Quick way” to get started to correctly set-up CodeCommit, CodePipeline, 
CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, etc… 
- Can edit the code ”in-the-cloud” using AWS Cloud9

### AWS Cloud9 
- AWS Cloud9 is a cloud IDE (Integrated 
Development Environment) for writing, running 
and debugging code
- “Classic” IDE (like IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code…) 
are downloaded on a computer before being 
used
- A cloud IDE can be used within a web browser, 
meaning you can work on your projects from 
your office, home, or anywhere with internet 
with no setup necessary
- AWS Cloud9 also allows for code collaboration 
in real
-time (pair programming)


## Next Steps

- Systems Manager – SSM Session Manager
