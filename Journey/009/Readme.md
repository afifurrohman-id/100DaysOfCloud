Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services, that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. EC2 just like a Computer or Server in the Cloud.

## Cloud Research

- Elastic refers to the fact that you can easily increase or decrease the number of servers you run to support an application automatically, and you can also increase or decrease the size of existing servers. <br>

- Compute refers to reason why most users run servers in the first place, which is to host running applications or process dataâ€”actions that require compute resources, including processing power (CPU) and memory (RAM).<br>

- Cloud refers to the fact that the EC2 instances that you run are hosted in the cloud. Amazon EC2 provides virtual machines in the cloud and gives you full administrative control over the Windows or Linux operating system that runs on the instance. <br>
- Most server operating systems are supported, including: <br>
 > Windows 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2019 <br> Red Hat <br> SuSE <br> Ubuntu <br> and Amazon Linux<br>

- An operating system that runs on a virtual machine is often called a guest operating system to distinguish it from the host operating system. 

- The host operating system is directly installed on any server hardware that hosts one or more virtual machines.<br>

- With Amazon EC2, you can launch any number of instances of any size into any Availability Zone anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes.<br> Instances launch from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are effectively virtual machine templates. AMI

## Next Steps
