## Introduction
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

## Cloud Research

### Launch types
##### There are two models that you can use to run your containers:

 - Fargate launch type - This is a serverless pay-as-you-go option. You can run containers without needing to manage your infrastructure.

 - EC2 launch type - Configure and deploy EC2 instances in your cluster to run your containers.

##### The Fargate launch type is suitable for the following workloads:

 - Large workloads that need to be optimized for low overhead

 - Small workloads that have occasional burst

 - Tiny workloads

 - Batch workloads

##### The EC2 launch type is suitable for the following workloads:

 - Workloads that require consistently high CPU core and memory usage

 - Large workloads that need to be optimized for price

 - Your applications need to access persistent storage

 - You must directly manage your infrastructure

### Fargate 
- Launch Docker containers on
AWS
- You do not provision the
infrastructure (no EC2 instances
to manage)
– simpler!
- Serverless offering 
- AWS just runs containers for
you based on the CPU / RAM
you need

### ECR 

- Elastic Container Registry 
- Private Docker Registry on
AWS
- This is where you store your
Docker images so they can
be run by ECS or Fargate
