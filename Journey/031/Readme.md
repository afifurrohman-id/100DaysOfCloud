# Databases Intro (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Introduction
- Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have its limits
- Sometimes, you want to store data in a database…
- You can structure the data
- You build indexes to efficiently query / search through the data
- You define relationships between your datasets
- Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different
features, shapes and constraints

## Cloud Research

### Relational Databases
- A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, making it easy to see and understand how different data structures relate to each other.

### NoSQL Databases
- NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational databases
- NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have
flexible schemas for building modern applications.
- Benefits:
>• Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
<br>• Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
<br>• High-performance: optimized for a specific data model
<br>• Highly functional: types optimized for the data model
- Examples: Key-value, document, graph, in-memory, search databases

## Next Steps

- AWS RDS

## Social Proof
