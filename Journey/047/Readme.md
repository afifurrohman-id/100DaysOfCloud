## Cloud Research

### What is CloudFormation
- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS 
Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
>• I want a security group
<br>• I want two EC2 instances using this security group
<br>• I want an S3 bucket
<br>• I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the 
exact configuration that you specify


### Benefits of AWS CloudFormation 
- Infrastructure as code
>• No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
<br>• Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code

- Cost
>• Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how 
much a stack costs you
<br>• You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
<br>• Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and 
recreated at 8 AM, safely

- Productivity
>• Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
<br>• Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
<br>• Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)

- Don’t re-invent the wheel
>• Leverage existing templates on the web!
<br>• Leverage the documentation

- Supports (almost) all AWS resources:
>• Everything we’ll see in this course is supported
<br>• You can use “custom resources” for resources that are not supported

### AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
- Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
>• JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET
- The code is “compiled” into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
- You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
>• Great for Lambda functions
<br>• Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS

### Developer problems on AWS
- Managing infrastructure
- Deploying Code
- Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc
- Scaling concerns
- Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
- All the developers want is for their code to run!
- Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments
