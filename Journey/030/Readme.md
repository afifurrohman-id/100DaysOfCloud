# AWS OpsHub, Hybrid Cloud for Storage, AWS Storage Gateway (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Cloud Research

### AWS OpsHub
- Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you
needed a CLI (Command Line Interface tool)
- Today, you can use AWS OpsHub (a software you install on your computer / laptop) to
manage your Snow Family Device
>• Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
<br>• Transferring files
<br>• Launching and managing instances running on Snow
Family Devices
<br>• Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active
instances on your device)
<br>• Launch compatible AWS services on your devices
(ex: Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, Network File System (NFS))


### Hybrid Cloud for Storage
- AWS is pushing for ”hybrid cloud”
>• Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
<br>• Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
- This can be due to
>• Long cloud migrations
<br>• Security requirements
<br>• Compliance requirements
<br>• IT strategy
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you
expose the S3 data on-premise?
- AWS Storage Gateway!

### AWS Storage Gateway
- Bridge between on-premise data and cloud
data in S3
- Hybrid storage service to allow on- premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup &
restore, tiered storage
- Types of Storage Gateway:
>• File Gateway
<br>• Volume Gateway
<br>• Tape Gateway
- No need to know the types at the exam
