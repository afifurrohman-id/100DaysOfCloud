# AWS Global Infrastructure (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Introduction
The AWS Global Infrastructure is designed and built to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and securecloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance. The journey will be like this:
- AWS Regions 
- AWS Availability Zones 
- AWS Edge Locations /
Points of Presence

## Cloud Research
- AWS Regions 
• AWS has Regions all around the world 
• Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3… 
• A region is a cluster of data centers 
• Most AWS services are region-scope

- AWS Availability Zones
• Each region has many availability zones
(usually 3, min is 2, max is 6). Example:
• ap-southeast-2a
• ap-southeast-2b
• ap-southeast-2c
• Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more
discrete data centers with redundant power,
networking, and connectivity
• They’re separate from each other, so that
they’re isolated from disasters
• They’re connected with high bandwidth,
ultra-low latency networking

- AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
• Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & 11 Regional
Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries
• Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
