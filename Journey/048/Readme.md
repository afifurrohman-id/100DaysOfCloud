# AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Introduction
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying 
an application on AWS
- It uses all the component’s we’ve seen before:
EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc… 
- But it’s all in one view that’s easy to make sense of! 
- We still have full control over the configuration 
- Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
- Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances


## Cloud Research

### Elastic Beanstalk 
- Managed service 
>• Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk 
<br>• Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk 
<br>• Capacity provisioning 
<br>• Load balancing & auto-scaling 
<br>• Application health-monitoring & responsiveness 

- Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer 

- Three architecture models: 
>• Single Instance deployment: good for dev 
<br>• LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications 
<br>• ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc..)


- Support for many platforms:
>• Go
<br>• Java SE
<br>• Java with Tomcat
<br>• .NET on Windows Server with IIS
<br>• Node.js
<br>• PHP
<br>• Python
<br>• Ruby
<br>• Packer Builder
<br>• Single Container Docker
<br>• Multi-Container Docker
<br>• Preconfigured Docker
- If not supported, you can write 
your custom platform (advanced)

## Next Steps

- AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeArtifact, AWS CodeStar, AWS Cloud9
