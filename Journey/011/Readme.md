# EC2 Instance (Web Server), EC2 Instance Types Basics & Security Groups (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Introduction
Now practice in real EC2!. The journey will be like this:
- Create, Terminated EC2 Instance (Web Server)

## Cloud Research

### Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
• Launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console<br>
• Get a first high-level approach to the various parameters<br>
• See that web server is launched using EC2 user data<br>

### EC2 Instance Types 
• Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories<br>
• Balance between:
