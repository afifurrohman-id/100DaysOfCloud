# Elastic Load Balancing & Auto Scaling Groups (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Introduction
Elastic Load Balancing helps to manage incoming requests by optimally routing traffic so that no one instance is overwhelmed. To use Elastic Load Balancing with your Auto Scaling group, attach the load balancer to your Auto Scaling group. The journey will be like this:
- Scalability & High Availability
- Vertical Scalability
- Horizontal Scalability
- High Availability
- High Availability & Scalability For EC2
- Scalability vs Elasticity (vs Agility)

## Cloud Research

### Scalability & High Availability
- Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads
by adapting.
- There are two kinds of scalability:
> Vertical Scalability
<br> Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

### Vertical Scalability
- Vertical Scalability means increasing the size
of the instance
- For example, your application runs on a
t2.micro
- Scaling that application vertically means
running it on a t2.large
- Vertical scalability is very common for non
distributed systems, such as a database.
- There’s usually a limit to how much you can
vertically scale (hardware limit)

### Horizontal Scalability
- Horizontal Scalability means increasing the
number of instances / systems for your
application
- Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems.
-This is very common for web applications /
modern applications
- It’s easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud
offerings such as Amazon EC2

### High Availability first building in New York 
- High Availability usually goes hand
in hand with horizontal scaling
- High availability means running
your application / system in at
least 2 Availability Zones
- The goal of high availability is to
survive a data center loss
(disaster

### High Availability & Scalability For EC2
- Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
> From: t2.nano - 0.5G of RAM, 1 vCPU
<br> To: u-12tb1.metal – 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
- Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (= scale out / in)
> Auto Scaling Group
<br> Load Balancer
- High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
> Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
<br> Load Balancer multi AZ

### Scalability vs Elasticity (vs Agility)
- Scalability: ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware
stronger (scale up), or by adding nodes (scale out)
- Elasticity: once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be
some “auto-scaling” so that the system can scale based on the load. This
is “cloud-friendly”: pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs
- Agility: (not related to scalability - distractor) new IT resources are only
a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those
resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.
