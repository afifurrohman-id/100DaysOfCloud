# Amazon S3 – Security (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Cloud Research

### Amazon S3 – Security
- User-Based
>• IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
- Resource-Based
>• Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
<br>• Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled)
<br>• Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)
- Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
>• The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
<br>• AND there’s no explicit DENY
- Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

### S3 Bucket Policies 
- JSON based policies 
>• Resources: buckets and objects 
<br>• Effect: Allow / Deny 
<br>• Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny 
<br>• Principal: The account or user to apply the
policy to<br>

- Use S3 bucket for policy to: 
>• Grant public access to the bucket <br>• Force objects to be encrypted at upload <br>• Grant access to another account (Cross
Account)

## Next Steps

- Amazon S3 – Static Website Hosting, Amazon S3 -Versioning, Amazon S3 – Replication (CRR & SRR)
