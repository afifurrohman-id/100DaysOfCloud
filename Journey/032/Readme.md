# AWS RDS (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Introduction
- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
>• Postgres
<br>• MySQL
<br>• MariaDB
<br>• Oracle
<br>• Microsoft SQL Server
<br>• Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

## Cloud Research

### Advantage over using RDS versus deploying
DB on EC2
- RDS is a managed service:
>• Automated provisioning, OS patching
<br>• Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
<br>• Monitoring dashboards
<br>• Read replicas for improved read performance
<br>• Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
<br>• Maintenance windows for upgrades
<br>• Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
<br>• Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
- BUT you can’t SSH into your instances

### Amazon Aurora
- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- PostgreSQL and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB
- Aurora is “AWS cloud optimized” and claims 5x performance improvement
over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB.
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient
- Not in the free tier

### RDS Deployments: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ
- Read Replicas:
>• Scale the read workload of your DB
<br>• Can create up to 5 Read Replicas
<br>• Data is only written to the main DB

- Multi-AZ:
>• Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
<br>• Data is only read/written to the main database
<br>• Can only have 1 other AZ as failover

### RDS Deployments: Multi-Region
- Multi-Region (Read Replicas)
>• Disaster recovery in case of region issue
<br>• Local performance for global reads
<br>• Replication cost

## Next Steps

- Amazon ElastiCache

## Social Proof
