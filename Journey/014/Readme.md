# EC2 Instance Connect & EC2 Instance Purchasing Options (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Cloud Research

### EC2 Instance Connect
- Connect to EC2 instance within browser
- No need to use key file that was downloaded
- The “magic” is that a temporary key is uploaded onto EC2 by AWS
- Works only out-of-the-box with Amazon Linux 2
- Need to make sure the port 22 is still opened!

### EC2 Instances Purchasing Options:
- On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- Reserved (1 & 3 years)
- Reserved Instances – long workloads
- Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
- Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) –commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- Spot Instances – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware
- Capacity Reservations – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
