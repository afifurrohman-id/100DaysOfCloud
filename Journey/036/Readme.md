# Amazon QuickSight, DocumentDB, Amazon Neptune (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Cloud Research

### Amazon QuickSight
- Serverless machine learning-powered business intelligence service to
create interactive dashboards
- Fast, automatically scalable, embeddable, with per-session pricing
- Use cases:
>• Business analytics
<br>• Building visualizations
<br>• Perform ad-hoc analysis
<br>• Get business insights using data
- Integrated with RDS, Aurora,
Athena, Redshift, S3…


### DocumentDB
- Aurora is an “AWS-implementation” of PostgreSQL / MySQL …
- DocumentDB is the same for MongoDB (which is a NoSQL database)
- MongoDB is used to store, query, and index JSON data
- Similar “deployment concepts” as Aurora
- Fully Managed, highly available with replication across 3 AZ
- DocumentDB storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB.
- Automatically scales to workloads with millions of requests per seconds

### Amazon Neptune 
- Fully managed graph database 
- A popular graph dataset would be a social network 
>• Users have friends 
<br>• Posts have comments 
<br>• Comments have likes from users 
<br>• Users share and like posts… 
- Highly available across 3 AZ, with up to 15 read replicas 
- Build and run applications working with highly connected
datasets
– optimized for these complex and hard queries
- Can store up to billions of relations and query the graph with
milliseconds latency
- Highly available with replications across multiple AZs 
- Great for knowledge graphs (Wikipedia), fraud detection,
recommendation engines, social networking

## Next Steps

- Amazon QLDB, Amazon Managed Blockchain, AWS Glue 

## Social Proof
