# Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena (Udemy | Stephane Mareek)

## Cloud Research

### Amazon Redshift
- Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but it’s not used for OLTP
- It’s OLAP – online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)
- Load data once every hour, not every second
- 10x better performance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data
- Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
- Massively Parallel Query Execution (MPP), highly available
- Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned
- Has a SQL interface for performing the queries
- BI tools such as AWS Quicksight or Tableau integrate with it

### Amazon EMR
- EMR stands for “Elastic MapReduce”
- EMR helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process
vast amount of data
- The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances
- Also supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink…
- EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configuration
- Auto-scaling and integrated with Spot instances
- Use cases: data processing, machine learning, web indexing, big data…

### Amazon Athena
- Serverless query service to analyze data stored in Amazon S3
- Uses standard SQL language to query the files
- Supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet (built on Presto)
- Pricing: $5.00 per TB of data scanned
- Use compressed or columnar data for cost-savings (less scan)
- Use cases: Business intelligence / analytics / reporting, analyze &
query VPC Flow Logs, ELB Logs, CloudTrail trails, etc...
- Exam Tip: analyze data in S3 using serverless SQL, use Athena

## Next Steps

- Amazon QuickSight, DocumentDB, Amazon Neptune

## Social Proof
