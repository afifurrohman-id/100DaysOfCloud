## Cloud Research

### How Systems Manager works
- We need to install the SSM 
agent onto the systems we 
control
- Installed by default on Amazon 
Linux AMI & some Ubuntu 
AMI
- If an instance can’t be 
controlled with SSM, it’s 
probably an issue with the 
SSM agent!
- Thanks to the SSM agent, we 
can run commands, patch & 
configure our servers

### Systems Manager – SSM Session Manager
- Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and 
on-premises servers
- No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed
- No port 22 needed (better security)
- Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Send session log data to S3 or CloudWatch Logs

### AWS OpsWorks
- Chef & Puppet help you perform server configuration automatically, or 
repetitive actions
- They work great with EC2 & On-Premises VM
- AWS OpsWorks = Managed Chef & Puppet
- It’s an alternative to AWS SSM
- Only provision standard AWS resources:
>• EC2 Instances, Databases, Load Balancers, EBS volumes… 
- In the exam: Chef or Puppet needed => AWS OpsWorks
